# experiments

This repository contains some experiments build without any specific purpose, just to learn and demonstrate some programming technics.

This implies that the modules may not work, won't meet my own demands on documentation, code style, test coverage. You've been warned.

## serstapa
With [**Ser**vice **Sta**tus **Pa**ge](serstapa) I'll try to gain some basic knowledge about AngularJS, maven and JAX-RS.

The goal is to build some kind of a dashboard to maintain and publish information about services, like availability, outages etc. Think about [Twittter API Health Page](https://dev.twitter.com/status).
